Twilight Zone

Did I dream the whole thing?
Was I just a nightmare?
Different dimensions
Stuck in the twilight zone
Is this a black and white scene?
If so, then I'm in the gray one
Hope you win for best actor
'Cause I had you completely wrong
Does she know you're not who you say you are?
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all?
And it's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange, this I never do
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'd ever change a thing
'Cause I'm right here, where I'm meant to be
Not that I'd call you, I won't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened
Were we just mistaken?
Disguised our intentions?
Our nest was a masquerade (masquerade)
Why do I still protect you? (Mm)
Pretend these songs aren't about you (songs aren't about you)
Hope this might be the last one
'Cause I'm not fooling anyone
Does she know you're not who you say you are?
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all?
And it's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange, this I never do
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'd ever change a thing
'Cause I'm right here, where I'm meant to be
Not that I'd call you, I won't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'm (over you)
It's so strange (I don't miss you)
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes, I just can't believe (can't believe)
You happened
